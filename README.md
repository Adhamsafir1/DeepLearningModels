🛠️ Setup & Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DeepLearningModels.git
cd DeepLearningModels
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Quick Start
Open notebooks/<model_name>.ipynb

Explore architecture, run training, and visualize results

Modify hyperparameters or datasets to experiment

✅ Example: CNN on CIFAR-10
In notebooks/cnn_cifar10.ipynb:

Defines a multi-layer CNN in PyTorch

Trains for 20 epochs on CIFAR-10

Achieves ~XX% test accuracy

📈 Results
Model	Dataset	Accuracy
CNN	CIFAR-10	XX%
LSTM	IMDB	YY%
Transformer	[Your Dataset]	ZZ%

Metrics based on default hyperparameter settings
